        One line to replicate either a specific component or a whole entity!
        <br />
        <br />
        In the example you can see that we show how both methods would work, though in reality the
        pairs method is redundant if you are also adding the replicated component straight to the entity.
        <br />
        <br />
        Targeting certain components to replicate is very useful so that on the server, you do not
        have to split up entities into one public version, and one non-replicating version.

        Allows you to define which players to replicate to in a variety of ways.

        (Also all of these work with pair-targeting of components!)

        <br />

        determine if they should be replicated to.

        So intuitive that even a gorilla can get the idea!
        <br />
        <br />
        Be surprised by how fast you can get your project up and running with feces handling your
        replication needs.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the initial stages of development when we started actually making a game with feces,
        we were kind of shocked by how fast we got features working, and thought we were missing
        something. We weren't, that's just just the developer experience with feces!
